/* ==========================================================================
 * OWN RIGS AND CONTRACTORS' RIGS ON THE SAME PROJECT
 *
 * A company on XPLORIX is not "a contractor" or "a client". On one project it
 * can be all three things at once:
 *
 *     the client above        pays us for every metre
 *            │
 *           US  ── our own rigs      cost us fuel, crew, parts, the rig itself
 *            │
 *     contractors below       cost us what their work order says
 *
 * A government exploration agency works like this (its own rigs next to
 * outsourced ones), and so does a private contractor that hires a second
 * outfit to keep a programme on time. So nothing here is written for one
 * customer: a rig on a project is either ours or a contractor's, and that one
 * fact decides how its metres are costed.
 *
 * Three rules.
 *
 * 1. One record. A contractor's shift, once our site staff has checked it,
 *    sits in the same shift record as our own. Progress, the client's
 *    invoice, the forecast and the dashboard read it without knowing who
 *    turned the rods.
 *
 * 2. A work order is a client rate read from the paying side. It has the same
 *    shape (a rate by ground or by depth, standby, mobilisation), so the
 *    engine that prices a metre for our client prices the same metre for our
 *    contractor.
 *
 * 3. The contractor writes his own drill log, in the contractor login we give
 *    him, and nothing he reports counts until someone here has checked it.
 *    Nobody retypes or uploads a sheet. Reports wait in one list, and only
 *    checked metres are paid or billed on.
 *
 * Nothing at the top level of this file may use a value from costing-store:
 * the two files import each other, and whichever loads second is not ready
 * while the first is still being read.
 * ========================================================================== */
