/* ==========================================================================
 * XPLORIX COSTING
 *
 * Two rules run through this whole file.
 *
 * 1. Quantities come from the logs. Rates come from Set rates.
 *    Metres, hours, crew counts, fuel, water and additives are recorded in the
 *    driller's log; repair cost comes from the maintenance log; parts from
 *    inventory. Nothing measurable is ever typed on a costing screen.
 *
 * 2. Rates are dated, and costing looks up the rate in force on the day.
 *    A hole closed in March keeps its March rate forever. Reclassify in month
 *    four and month four onward changes; nothing before it moves. An invoice
 *    already sent can never silently stop matching the screen.
 *
 * Cost is built in layers and the UI keeps them apart:
 *
 *   operating   fuel + water + additives + crew + repairs + parts
 *   ownership   depreciation + EMI + insurance, allocated per day
 *   full        operating + ownership          <- cost per unit divides this
 *
 * Mobilisation and demobilisation sit outside that stack: dated lump sums,
 * billed on their own line. Spreading a one-off move across a month's metres
 * makes every hole that month read wrong.
 * ========================================================================== */
